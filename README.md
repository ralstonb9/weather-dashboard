# weather-dashboard

## Description

This weeks challenge was to create an app that can tell you the weather based on the city you search. In this challenge we not only had to display the name of the city and the current temperature, wind speed and humidity we also had to do it for the next 5 days as well. to do this was easier said than done as the temperature needed to be converted to farenheight and we also had to create a search history feature.

## Usage

the weather dashboard app is very straightforward in terms of its usage. To use this app you simply need to type in whatever city you would like to know the weather in and it will display the current weather and the 5-day forecast.
